## W0003: Unnecessary parentheses in `for` expression

In Compose, `for` loop headers do not require parentheses. While required in some languages, parentheses in `for` loops are redundant in Compose and should be omitted for clarity and stylistic consistency.

---

### Example

```compose warn(W0003)
# let mut items = "abc".chars();
for (x in items) {
    print(x);
};
```

```output warn(W0003)
// autogenerated
```

âœ… **Fix:**

```compose
# let mut items = "abc".chars();
for x in items {
    print(x);
};
```

This warning is issued to encourage idiomatic Compose syntax and reduce visual clutter. It applies to `for`, `while`, and `if` conditions where parentheses are not required.

## E0007: A `let` binding must be followed by `=` or terminated with a semicolon or newline.

In Compose, a `let` statement introduces a new variable binding. After the binding pattern (e.g., `count`), the parser expects either:

- an initializer with `=`,
- or a semicolon (`;`).

---

### Example

```compose error(E0007)
let count 42;
```

```output error(E0007)
// autogenerated
```

✅ **Fix:**

```compose
let count = 42;
```

or

```compose
let count; 42
```

---

This requirement avoids ambiguity between incomplete bindings and separate expressions. Use `=` to initialise, or a semicolon to end the declaration.

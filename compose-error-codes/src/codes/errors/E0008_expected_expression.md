## E0007: An expression was expected but none was found

In Compose, many constructs require a valid expression — such as operands in arithmetic, the right-hand side of a `let` binding, or the body of a block. This error occurs when the parser expects the start of an expression but finds an invalid token instead (such as a closing delimiter or a misplaced keyword).

### Example

```compose error
let value = +
```

✅ **Fix:**

```compose
let value = 1 + 2
```

or

```compose
let value = +some_number
```

---

This error is typically caused by:

* A missing operand (e.g., after a binary operator),
* An incomplete function call,
* A misplaced or unmatched delimiter,
* Or accidentally leaving an expression blank.

Make sure the syntax is complete and begins with a valid expression construct like a literal, identifier, operator, function call, or block.
